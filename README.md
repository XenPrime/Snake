# Snake
Simple Snake game with boarder, food, the snake, and scorekeeping as well as collision details.
A Snake game in C++ is a classic and simple video game that allows players to control a snake moving around a grid-like game board. The primary objective of the game is to control the snake to collect food items, grow in size, and avoid collisions with the boundaries of the game board or the snake's own tail. Here's a description of the key components and mechanics of a typical Snake game in C++:

**Game Board:**
- The game is typically played on a rectangular grid, where each grid cell represents a possible position for the snake and food items.
- The grid can be displayed in the console or using a graphical library for a more visually appealing experience.

**Snake:**
- The player controls a snake that starts with a single segment.
- The snake moves continuously in a specific direction (up, down, left, or right) determined by player input.
- The snake's objective is to eat food items to grow longer.

**Food:**
- Food items randomly appear on the game board at predefined intervals.
- The snake must navigate to the food items to consume them and increase its length.
- Each time the snake eats food, the player's score typically increases.

**Game Mechanics:**
- The snake moves one step in its current direction with each game tick.
- Players can change the snake's direction using keyboard input (arrow keys or other designated keys).
- The game continues until a collision occurs (snake hits the game board boundaries or collides with itself), ending the game.
- Players often aim to achieve the highest possible score by collecting food items and growing the snake as long as possible.

**Scorekeeping:**
- The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases each time the snake eats food.
- The score is typically displayed on the screen, allowing players to track their progress.

**Collision Detection:**
- Collision detection is a critical aspect of the game, ensuring that the snake detects collisions with the game board boundaries or itself.
- When a collision occurs, the game ends, and the player's score is displayed.

**Difficulty Scaling:**
- Some Snake games increase the snake's speed or alter game mechanics as the player's score or game time progresses, making the game more challenging.

**Visual Feedback:**
- Visual feedback is provided to enhance the gaming experience, such as animations when the snake eats food or visual cues for game over scenarios.

**Game Over:**
- When the game ends (due to a collision or other loss condition), a "Game Over" message is displayed along with the player's final score.
- Players often have the option to restart the game.

A Snake game in C++ is not only a fun and nostalgic gaming experience but also a practical project for beginners to practice coding fundamentals, such as game loops, user input, and collision detection. It can be expanded and customized with additional features and graphics to create more advanced versions.
